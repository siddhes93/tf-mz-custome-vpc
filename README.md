# tf-mz-custome-vpc
clone this repo in your local. execute the commands in a order. 

1. terraform init
2. terraform validate
3. terraform plan
4. terraform apply 
5. terraform destroy  --Note: This command will completely delete the resources that are created using Terraform. 

Note: Based on your use case/business requirments please modify the aws region, subnets CIDR, VPC CIDR. in this example used 2 subnets for both public and private. 

Below is the complete log of above action performed.

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-94-121 mz-custom-vpc]$ terraform validate
Success! The configuration is valid.

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-94-121 mz-custom-vpc]$ terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
